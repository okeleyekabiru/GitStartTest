# Gitstart Microservices 

This repository contains three interconnected microservices for user authentication, product management, and inventory management. All services are built using ASP.NET Core and use Docker Compose to simplify the setup process.

## Overview

### Microservices

1. **Authentication Service**
   - User registration, login, and management functionalities.

2. **Product Service**
   - Manage products, including CRUD operations and pagination.

3. **Inventory Service**
   - Handle inventory items and stock transactions.

### Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server
- Redis
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/okeleyekabiru/GitStartTest>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Docker Compose Setup

This project uses Docker Compose to set up the environment. The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to run all three microservices alongside SQL Server and Redis.

### Configuration

Ensure that your `appsettings.json` or environment variables are set correctly for database connections and Redis configuration in each service.

### Running the Application

To build and start the application with all dependencies, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:

1. Build the microservice images.
2. Start SQL Server and Redis containers.
3. Spin up the Authentication, Product, and Inventory APIs.

### Accessing the APIs

Once the containers are up, the APIs will be accessible at:

- **Authentication API**: `http://localhost:<auth-api-port>/api/auth`
- **Product API**: `http://localhost:<product-api-port>/api/products`
- **Inventory API**: `http://localhost:<inventory-api-port>/api/inventory`

Replace `<auth-api-port>`, `<product-api-port>`, and `<inventory-api-port>` with the ports configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication Service

| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                     |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| POST   | /api/auth/register         | Register a new user            |
| POST   | /api/auth/login            | Authenticate a user             |
| PUT    | /api/auth/user/{userId}   | Update user details             |
| DELETE | /api/auth/user/{userId}   | Delete a user                   |

#### Product Service

| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                     |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/products              | Retrieve all products           |
| GET    | /api/products/{id}         | Get product by ID               |
| POST   | /api/products              | Create a new product            |
| PUT    | /api/products/{id}         | Update an existing product      |
| DELETE | /api/products/{id}         | Delete a product                |

#### Inventory Service

| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                     |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/inventory             | Retrieve all inventory items    |
| GET    | /api/inventory/{id}        | Get inventory item by ID        |
| POST   | /api/inventory             | Create a new inventory item     |
| PUT    | /api/inventory/{id}        | Update an existing inventory item|
| DELETE | /api/inventory/{id}        | Delete an inventory item        |

## Running Tests

To run unit and integration tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Stopping the Application

To stop and remove the containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Improvements

Given more time, I would have made the following enhancements:

- **SQL Optimization**: I would showcase my SQL expertise by using raw SQL scripts for more complex queries instead of relying solely on LINQ. This would allow for better query optimization and performance.
  
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: I would create comprehensive Kubernetes manifests to orchestrate the deployment of the microservices. This would include defining Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to ensure seamless scaling in production environments.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Completion**: The GitHub Actions pipeline would be completed to include automated deployment to Kubernetes. This would ensure a fully automated and streamlined CI/CD process, covering building, testing, containerizing, and deployment stages.

- **Enhanced Unit Testing**: While I covered unit tests, I did not capture all possible negative scenarios due to time constraints. Additional testing would be added to ensure better test coverage, including edge cases.

- **Validation**: FluentValidation could have been implemented to handle input validation more effectively. Due to limited time, I relied on data annotations, but FluentValidation would offer more flexibility and cleaner validation logic.

- **Architecture**: I intend use rabbitMQ for communication between product and inventory, should be incase a product  is deleted the service should trigger an event to inventory to handle the side effect.
